INTRODUCTION
</p>


<p>
The manuscript copies of these two plays by Charles Macklin, A WILL
AND NO WILL, OR A BONE FOR THE LAWYERS (1746) and THE NEW PLAY
CRITICIZ'D, OR THE PLAGUE OF ENVY (1747), are in the Larpent
Collection of the Huntington Library along with a third afterpiece
<i>The Covent Garden Theatre, or Pasquin Turn'd Drawcansir</i> (1752)
already reproduced in facsimile as Number 116 of the Augustan Reprint
Society.<a href="#note1i" name="noteref1i">
<small>[1]</small></a> Since the introduction to <i>Covent Garden Theatre</i>
(ARS 116) already gives general biographical information on this
actor-playwright, Charles Macklin, as well as an indication of the
revived interest in his plays, this introduction will be limited to
the two afterpieces here reproduced.
</p>

<p>
A WILL AND NO WILL, OR A BONE FOR THE LAWYERS (Larpent 58) was first
produced in 1746 and revived many times up to March 29, 1756, unlike
<i>The Covent Garden Theatre</i> which was given only one performance
in 1752. The Larpent manuscript 58 copy of A WILL AND NO WILL bears
the handwritten application of James Lacy to the Lord Chamberlain for
permission to perform the farce for Mrs. Macklin's benefit. It was
first performed at the Drury Lane Theatre April 23, 1746, following
<i>Humours of the Army</i>.<a href="#note2i" name="noteref2i">
<small>[2]</small></a> Sometimes advertised with a different
subtitle as A WILL AND NO WILL, OR A NEW CASE FOR THE LAWYERS,<a href="#note3i" name="noteref3i">
<small>[3]</small></a> it
was revived March 22, 1748, for Macklin's own benefit and apparently
was more popular in the revival since it was repeated five more times
on March 29, 31 and April 11, 21, 22.<a href="#note4i" name="noteref4i">
<small>[4]</small></a> The last performance listed
in <i>The London Stage</i>, Part 4, II, 535, was for Macklin's
daughter's benefit on March 29, 1756.
</p>

<p>
Macklin's two-act farce, A WILL AND NO WILL, is based on Regnard's
five-act comedy <i>le Legetaire Universel</i> (1707), which is itself
a composite of Italian comedy with echoes of Moli&egrave;re, moving from
scene to scene with little effort at logical consistency or structure
but treating each scene autonomously for its own comic value.<a href="#note5i" name="noteref5i">
<small>[5]</small></a>
Macklin condensed and tightened Regnard's five-act plot into a two-act
afterpiece; the role of the apothecary is greatly reduced into the
stock London-stage Frenchman, du Maigre, who can barely speak English;
the servant Lucy is more the English maid than the French <i>bonne</i>
of the Regnard play who gave orders to her master; and the satire of
Macklin's afterpiece is directed not only at lawyers and physicians,
as in the Regnard play, but at Methodist itinerant preachers. Finally
Macklin's plot was both complicated and tightened by having the
lawyers summoned to draw up the marriage contract, also take down the
will of the supposed Skinflint, thus making the marriage a condition
of the will.
</p>

<p>
The rather long Prologue to A WILL AND NO WILL (11 pages of manuscript)
makes fun of the convention of the eighteenth century prologues by the
familiar dodge of having two actors chatting as though they were in
the Pit waiting for the actors in the main play to dress for the
afterpiece. The conversation of the Prologue is enlivened by the
appearance of an Irish lawyer come to see the play about lawyers. His
impossibly long name, Laughlinbulhuderry-Mackshoughlinbulldowny,
contains hints of Macklin's own name, and this is also one of
Macklin's wonderful Irishmen who never acted except in school where he
spoke the Prologue, he says, of one of Terence's tragedies when the
play was over. His mispronunciations and inaccuracies put him at the
head of the list of stage Irishmen whom Macklin, an Irishman himself,
could portray with delight and authority.
</p>

<p>
Another feature of the long Prologue to this farce is Macklin's
reference to the failure of his own tragedy <i>Henry VII</i> (1745),
for Snarlewit proclaims that he never had so much fun in his life as
at Macklin's "merry Tragedy." The ability to laugh at his own failure
to construct a tragedy hastily in time to capitalize on the invasion
attempt of 1745, together with his reference to his own name in his
caricature of the Irish lawyer undoubtedly help explain the success of
this farcical afterpiece.
</p>

<p>
Occasional marks of the Licenser on the manuscript, most notably
opposite Shark's lines about statesmen at the end of Act I, are all
underscored in the typescript of the play.
</p>

<p>
The second afterpiece here reproduced, THE NEW PLAY CRITICIZ'D, OR THE
PLAGUE OF ENVY (Larpent 64), is an amusing bit of dramatic criticism
of Benjamin Hoadly's <i>The Suspicious Husband</i> which had opened at
the Covent Garden Theatre on February 12, 1747, and was given many
times including performances on March 21, 24 and April 28, 30 of the
same year.<a href="#note6i" name="noteref6i">
<small>[6]</small></a> Again the title page of the Macklin afterpiece bears the
handwritten request of James Lacy, dated March 17, 1747, for the Lord
Chamberlain's permission to perform the play for Macklin's benefit at
Drury Lane on March 24. Both performances, then, of Macklin's closely
related afterpiece, THE NEW PLAY CRITICIZ'D, were given at Drury Lane
on nights when Hoadly's <i>The Suspicious Husband</i> was also being
performed at the rival theatre, March 24 and April 30, 1747. It was
even possible for a spectator to see Hoadly's play at Covent Garden
and then catch Macklin's related farcical afterpiece at the Drury Lane
Theatre on the same night. Or if that required too difficult a change
of <i>locus</i>, it was still possible to see <i>The Suspicious
Husband</i> on March 21 or April 28 and THE SUSPICIOUS HUSBAND
CRITICIZ'D (as Macklin's play is entitled in James T. Kirkman's
<i>Memoirs of the Life of Charles Macklin, Esq.</i>, II, 443) a few
days later on March 24 or April 30; such was the immediacy of the
appeal of Macklin's afterpiece.
</p>

<p>
While Macklin was capitalizing on the popularity of a new play, he
also, in THE NEW PLAY CRITICIZ'D, gave ironic portraits of rival
playwrights who damned a play out of envy (note the subtitle, THE
PLAGUE OF ENVY) for such trivial faults as the use of
<i>suspicious</i> instead of <i>jealous</i> in the title, or for the
lacing of Ranger's hat. Macklin's satiric portraits of such envious
scribblers who were ready to attack any new author in Journals,
Epigrams, and Pamphlets are lively records of mid-eighteenth century
subjective criticism. Canker, the envious playwright in the
afterpiece, calls Ranger "a Harlequin" and Mr. Strickland,
"Columbine's husband." Canker objects to the escapes, scenes in the
dark, and the rope ladder, though the young lovers, Heartly and
Harriet in Macklin's afterpiece, vow the ladder is a device they
themselves will use if Harriet is forced by her aunt to marry Canker.
Again an Irishman, Sir Patrick Bashfull, enlivens the farce by his
pretense of being a Frenchman, Fitzbashfull, "of Irish distraction."
Bashfull's literal criticism of Hoadly's play serves as a good foil
for the carping criticism of the envious playwrights: Plagiary,
Grubwit, and Canker; or the nonsense of the foolish critics: Nibble
and Trifle. The farce ends with Canker completely routed and Heartly's
suggestion that their hour's conversation would make a <i>petit
piece</i> in itself if Lady Critick would only write it down.
</p>

<p>
The limited appeal of this kind of related, topical afterpiece
probably explains why it was performed only twice, following a
performance of <i>Hamlet</i> on March 24, 1747, for Macklin's benefit,
and following <i>Julius Caesar</i> on April 30, 1747, for the benefit
of Garrick who had appeared as Ranger in the original cast of Hoadly's
play. The separate Prologue to Macklin's afterpiece is addressed to
Mr. Macklin in Bow Street, Covent Garden, and attributed to Hely
Hutcheson, Provost of Trinity College by William Cooke's <i>Memoirs of
Charles Macklin, Comedian</i> (1804), p. 152.
</p>

<p>
These two afterpieces, A WILL AND NO WILL (1746) and THE NEW PLAY
CRITICIZ'D (1747) along with <i>Covent Garden Theatre</i> (1752), ARS
116, bring up to date the publication of Charles Macklin's unpublished
work. It is to be hoped that a definitive critical edition of his
writing for the eighteenth-century stage will soon follow.
</p>

<p>
A word should be added about the editor's changes of these two plays
in the typescript. From the facsimile edition of Macklin's <i>Covent
Garden Theatre</i> (ARS 116) it should already be evident that
Macklin's scribes in these three plays in the Larpent Collection were
inconsistent both in spelling and punctuation. The <i>Covent Garden
Theatre</i> appeared in facsimile in response to requests for an
eighteenth-century facsimile for use in graduate seminars, because of
the clarity of its handwriting. The other two plays are here
reproduced in typescript since the condition of the manuscripts made
facsimile reproduction unfeasible. In the preparation of the
typescript for these remaining two plays, certain problems had of
necessity to be decided arbitrarily. Wherever it was possible, the
manuscript spelling has been preserved. Punctuation and capitals had
to be altered where sentences were run together or new sentences began
with small letters. The number of capital letters was reduced since
these followed no consistent pattern for emphasis and varied between
the scribes of the manuscripts. Nouns were left capitalized to
preserve the eighteenth-century flavor. Proper names have been
corrected to a recognizable form (Ranelagh for Renelagh, Zoilus for
Ziolus, for example); French phrases have been left in the manuscript
spelling for those characters who misuse French, such as Sir Patrick
Bashfull in THE NEW PLAY CRITICIZ'D. The occasional confusions of
characters or speakers have been corrected, with separate notes
explaining each change. All marks of the Licenser are in italics; all
words or letters interpolated by the editor are in brackets; all stage
directions are in parentheses. Applications by the Theatre Manager,
James Lacy, for permission to perform the plays, appear in notes.

(<i>The Curtain rises and discovers the Stage disposed in the Form of
a Pit and crowded with Actors who make a great Noise by Whistling and
Knocking for the Farce to begin</i>)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Consume them, why don't they begin?
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> I suppose some of them that were in the Play are
dressing for the Farce.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Psha! damn the Farce! They have had time enough to
dress since the Play has been over.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Dick Rattle, were you at the Boxing Match yesterday?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> No, my Dear, I was at the breakfasting at
Ranelagh.&mdash;Curse catch me, Jack<a href="#note2p" name="noteref2p">
<small>[2]</small></a>, if that is not a fine Woman in the
upper Box there, ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> So she is, by all that's charming,&mdash;but the poor
Creature's married; it's all over with her.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Smart, do you go to Newmarket this meeting,&mdash;upon my
Soul that's a lovely Woman on the right hand. But what the Devil can
this Prologue be about, I can't imagine. It has puzzled the whole
Town.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Depend upon it, Dick, it is as I said.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> What's that?
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Why one of the Fransique's, the French Harlequin's
Jokes; you will find that one of the Players come upon the Stage
presently, and make a[n] Apologie that they are disappointed of the
Prologue, upon which Macklin, or some other Actor is to start up in
the Pit, as one of the Audience, and bawl out that rather than so much
good Company should be disappointed, he will speak a Prologue himself.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> No, no, no, Smart. That's not it. I thought of that and
have been looking carefully all over the Pit, and there is not an
Actor in it. Now I fancy it is to be done like the Wall or the Man in
the Moon in Pyramus and Thisbe; Macklin will come in dressed like the
Pit and say:
</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen, I am the Pit</i></p>
<p><i>And a Prologue I'll speak if you think fit.</i></p></div></div>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> By Gad, Rattle, I fancy you have hit it. What do you
think, Mr. Dullman?
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ay, let us have Mr. Dullman's Opinion of it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dull.</i> Why really, Gentlemen, I have been thinking of it ever
since I first read it in the Papers&mdash;and I fancy&mdash;though to be sure,
it was very difficult to find out&mdash;but at last, I think I have hit
upon it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Well, well, my dear Dullman, communicate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dull.</i> I suppose there is some Person here among us whose name
is Pit, and that he will get up presently and speak a Prologue.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> O, O, O, O, O, Shocking! Shocking! Well conjectured,
Dullman.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Harkee, Jack, [let's] bam the Irishman. Ask him if he
knows anything of it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Don't you laugh then; he'll smoak us if you do; keep
your Countenance, and I'll engage I'll pitch-kettle him. Pray Sir, do
you know anything of this Prologue?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Who, me? Not upon my Honour. I know no more of it than
he that made it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> A Gentleman was saying just before the Play was over
that you were to be the Pit and to speak the Prologue; is there any
truth in it, Sir?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> No indeed, Sir, <i>it is as false as the Gospel</i>. I
do assure you, Sir, I never spoke a Pit or Prologue in my Life&mdash;but
once when I was at School, you must know, Sir,&mdash;we acted one of
Terence's Tragedies there, so when the Play was over I spoke the
Prologue to it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> I remember your Face very well. Pray Sir, don't you
belong to the Law?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Yes, at your Service, Sir&mdash;and so did my Father and
Grandfather before me, and all my Posterity. I myself solicit Cause at
the old Bailey and Hick's Hall, so I am come to see this BONE FOR THE
LAWYERS, because they say it is a Pun upon us Gentlemen of the long
Robe.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> He is a poor ridiculous Fellow, Jack (<i>aside</i>); he
is as great a Teague as Barrington himself.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Hush! Hush! Pray Sir, may I crave your name?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Yes you may indeed and welcome, Sir. My name is
Laughlinbullruderrymackshoughlinbulldowny, at your Service. And if you
have any Friend who is indicted for Robbery or Murder at any time or
has any other Law Suits upon his Hands at the old Bailey or Hick's
Hall, I should be proud to serve you and to be concerned in the Cause
likewise.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Whenever I have a Friend in such Circumstances, you may
depend upon being retained.

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Sir, I'll assure you no megrim. England understands the
Practice of those Courts better than myself. I know my Croaker upon
all the <i>In res</i> and for an Evidence, the Devil a Man in
Westminster Hall can tell an Evidence what to say better than I that
shits here; or hark you, if you should happen to want a Witness upon
Occasion, I believe, Sir, I could serve you.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> I am infinitely obliged to you. (<i>Bowing</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Sir, I am your most obsequious. (<i>Bowing</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> But pray Sir, what kind of Prologue do you think we
shall have tonight?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Why I believe it will be a kind of Prologue that will be
spoken by the Pit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Ay, that we suppose but in what Manner?
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> Why I am come here on purpose to know that, but I
suppose it will be in the manner of&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;by my Shoul I don't know
how it will be.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Upon my word, Sir, I think you give a very clear Account
of it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Jack, yonder's Snarlewit, the Poet and intimate Friend
of Macklin's; you are acquainted with him. Prithee call him; ten to
one but he can give us the History both of the Prologue and the Farce.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Hiss, Mr. Snarlewit, we have Room for you here, if you
will come and set by us; do you know Snarlewit, Dick?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> He is a devilish odd Fellow; he is one that never
speaks well of any Man behind his back nor ill of him to his Face and
is a most terrible Critick.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
(SNARLEWIT <i>steps over the Benches and sits down between</i> RATTLE
<i>and</i> SMART)
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Mr. Smart, your Servant. How do you do, Mr. Rattle?
What, you are come to hear the Pit speak the Prologue, I suppose. Ha!
Macklin's fine Conceit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Ay, we are so; do you know anything of it?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Psha! psha! a parcel of Stuff! a ridiculous Conceit of
the Blockhead's in imitation of a French writer who stole it from one
of the Greek Comic Poets.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> But in what manner is it to be done? Is it in Prose or
in Verse, or upon the Stage, or really in the Pit?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Lord, Sir, the Blockhead brings the Pit upon the Stage;
and the supposed Conversation there between the Play and the Farce is
to be the Prologue,&mdash;a French Conceit calculated merely to raise
Curiosity and fill the House, that's all.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Ay, and enough too, if it answers his purpose.
</p>

<p>
<i>Irish.</i> But pray, Sir, with humble Submission, if he brings the
Pit up on the Stage, how shall we be able to see the Farce unless we
go up into the Gallery?
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Very well observed, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Why this Fellow's an Idiot.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> No, no, he is only a Teague. But Mr. Snarlewit, do you
think this Prologue will be liked?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Psha! psha! liked, impossible! So it is for his Wife's
Benefit and meant as a Puff to fill her House, why perhaps the Town
may be so indulgent as to let it pass&mdash;but it is damned Trash! I
advised the Fool against it. But he persisted. He said he was sure it
would be better liked than the modern dull way of Prologue Writing
which for many years has been only to give the Audience an Historical
Account of the Comic Stoick or the Tragic Buskin, or a dull detail of
the piece they were to see with the Age and Circumstances of the
Author, and how long he was writing his Play. Now, says Macklin, my
Prologue, Sir, if it has nothing else, it has Novelty on its side; and
as Bays says it will elevate and surprize and all that. And if they
don't laugh at it as a good Prologue, I am sure, says he, they will
laugh at me for its being a bad one&mdash;so that either way they will have
their Joke.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Ay, ay, there I think he was right; for the Audience
will laugh, I make no doubt of it, but it will be at him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Right! Right!
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> So I told him but he would persist.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> But Mr. Snarlewit, how will he answer to the Critics his
making the Stage represent the Pit?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Psha! psha! he is below Criticism; they will never
trouble themselves about that. Besides I think he may be defended very
justly in that, for if the Stage has a Right to represent Palaces and
Countries, nay, and Heaven and Hell, surely it may be allowed to
exhibit the Pit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Do you know anything of the Farce?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Yes, I have read it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> It is a very odd Title, a Bone for the Lawyers; who is
the Author, pray? Is it known?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Why Macklin gives out that some Gentleman, a Friend of
his, has made him a Present of it, but I shrewdly suspect it to be his
own.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Whose! Macklin's?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Ay!
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> Why, can he write?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Write? Ay, and damnably too, I assure you, ha! ha! He
writ a Tragedy this Winter, but so merry a Tragedy was never seen
since the first night of Tom Thumb the Great.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> I was at it and a merry Tragedy it was and a merry
Audience!
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> I never laughed so heartily at a Play in my Life; if
his Farce has half so much Fun in it as his Tragedy had, I'll engage
it succeeds.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Come, come. There was some tolerable Things in his
Tragedy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Psha! psha! Stuff! Stuff! damned Stuff! Pray Sir, what
do you think of Lady Catherine Gordon's Letter to her Father, Lord
Huntley, that begun honoured Papa, hoping you are in good Health as I
am at this present Writing. There was a Stile for Tragedy!
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Well, I wish his Farce may succeed, however.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> O so do I upon my word, Sir.&mdash;I have a great Regard for
Macklin&mdash;but to be sure he is a very egregious Blockhead ever to think
of writing; that I believe everybody will allow.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ay, ay, there's nobody will dispute that with you, Mr.
Snarlewit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Notwithstanding he is such a Blockhead, I assure you,
Mr. Smart, I have an Esteem for him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> Do you know what Characters or Business he has in his
Farce?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> I think his chief Character is an old Fellow, one Sir
Isaac Skinflint, who is eaten up with Diseases, and who promises
everybody Legacies, but dreads making a Will, for the Instant he does
that he thinks he shall die.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rattle.</i> That's a very common Character; my Uncle was just such
a superstitious Wretch.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> And the Business of the Farce is to induce this old
Fellow to disinherit all his Relations, except a Nephew who wants to
be his sole Heir, which according to the Rules of Farce, you may
suppose it to be brought about by a Footman who upon these Occasions
always has more Wit than his Master.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> But when is the Prologue to begin?
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> Why as soon as the Curtain is drawn up you will see the
Stage disposed in the Form of a Pit, and that you are to imagine the
Prologue, and when they let the Curtain down, why then you must
suppose it to be ended.
</p>

<p>
<i>Smart.</i> I wonder what the Audience will say when it is over.
</p>

<p>
<i>Snarle.</i> What? Why some will stare and wonder what the Actors
have been about, and will still be expecting the Prologue; others will
chuckle at their Disappointment, and cry&mdash;they knew how it would be;
and some will judiciously observe&mdash;what better could be expected from
a Prologue to be written and spoken by the Pit. But upon the whole, I
dare say, ninety nine in a hundred will conclude it to be a parcell of
low Stuff&mdash;and that its only Merit was the quaintness of the Conceit
[which] raised the People's Curiosity and helped to fill the House;
and so ends the Prologue&mdash;and now let us make a Noise for the Farce.

</p>


<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Good morrow, Lucy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Good morrow, Shark.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Give me a Kiss, Hussy. (<i>Kisses her</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Psha&mdash;prithee don't touzle and mouzle a Body so; can't
you salute without rumpling one's Tucker and spoiling one's Things? I
hate to be tumbled. (<i>Adjusting herself</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Ay, as much as you do Flattery or a looking Glass.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Well, what's your Business this Morning? Have you any
Message?
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Yes, the old one: my Master's Duty to his gracious
Uncle, Sir Isaac Skinflint, and he hopes he rested well last
night&mdash;that is, to translate it out of the Language of Compliment into
that of Sincerity, he hopes the old Huncks has made his Will, my
Master his sole Heir, that he has had a very bad Night, and is within
a few Hours of giving up the Ghost and paying a Visit to his old
friend Belzebub.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> We were afraid he would have gone off last night; he has
had two of his Epileptic Feasts.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Why sure the old Cannibal would not offer to make his
Exit without making his Will; that would ruin us all.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Nay it would be a considerable Loss to me should he die
without a Will: for you know he has promised me a handsome Legacy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> And so he has to Thousands, my Dear; why, Child, I don't
believe he has spent thirty Shillings upon himself in Food for these
thirty years; all gratis, all upon the Spunge. Ay, ay, let Sir Isaac
Skinflint alone for mumping a Dinner. There has not been a
Churchwarden's or an Overseer's Feast these twenty years but what he
has been at. And when he is not at these Irish meals, he is preying
upon his Friends and Acquaintances, and promises them all Legacies.
"Well," he says, after he has filled his Paunch,&mdash;"I shall not forget
you. I shall remember all my Friends. I have you down in my Will."
Then he claps his hand upon the Servant's Head as he is going out&mdash;"I
shall think of you too, John. You are my old Friend"&mdash;but the Devil a
Louse he gives him; an old gouty Rogue! I'll warrant the old Hypocrite
has promised more Legacies than the Bank of England is able to pay.
Has he made any mention lately of his Nephew and Niece in the Country,
Sir Roger Bumper and his Sister?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> He expects them in Town today, or tomorrow at farthest,
and I believe he intends to make them joint Heirs with your Master.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> He may intend it, but shall not accomplish it, take my
word; if he does I'll never plot again. You say he has never seen
neither the Nephew nor the Niece since they were Children?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Never.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> Then he shall see them in my proper Person before he
sleeps, and if I don't make him disinherit them, say I am a Fool and
know nothing of Mankind.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Here your Master comes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shark.</i> He's welcome.

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> O Lucy, we are all undone.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Bless us; what's the matter, Sir?
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> I am just come from my Lady Lovewealth's, who, to my
great Surprize, has assured me that my Addresses to her Daughter for
the future will be highly improper, for that my Uncle had not only
refused to make such a Settlement on me as she liked, but had resolved
to marry Harriet himself.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Pray Sir, what says the young Lady to all this?
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> She seems to comply with her Mother's avaricious Temper,
but has vowed to me privately that should matters be brought to an
Extremity, she will never consent.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> You, Sir, must act the same part; seem to approve of the
Marriage by all means, for the more you oppose, the more violent they
will be. Trust the affair to Shark and me, and I'll engage we bring
you together in spite of Age and Avarice. I'll give the young Lady a
hint or two, which I believe will cure the old Fellow of his Lovefit!
Shark, go you and prepare your Disguises; do you act the Nephew and
the Niece well and I'll warrant everything else shall thrive.

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Dear Girl, the moment my Affairs are brought to bear, you
may depend upon the five hundred pounds I promised you.&mdash;Is my Uncle
up yet?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> He has been up this Hour&mdash;here he comes; be sure you
comply with him, let him say what he will.

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> A good morning to you, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> A good morning to you, Nephew. Auh! auh!
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> I am sorry to hear, Sir, you have had so bad a Night.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> I had indeed, Nephew; I was afraid it was all over. Such
another Fit would carry me off. Auh! auh!
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> But you are pretty well this morning, I hope, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Something better but very weak&mdash;very faint indeed,
Nephew! O&mdash;o&mdash;o, very faint.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> You should take something comfortable, Sir&mdash;Cordials to
repair the breaches you Illness hath made.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Lord, Nephew, it would require such a monstrous deal of
Money, and really these Syringe Carriers and Glyster Baggs and Doctors
give themselves such Airs, that a Man can't have their Assistance, nor
any of their Druggs and Slops under their Weight in Gold; therefore, I
think, Nephew, since we are to dye we had better save our Money.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> I grant you, Sir, the Fees of Surgeons and Physicians are
exorbitant,&mdash;yet as Health and Life are our most valuable Blessings,
we might lay a little out in Support of them&mdash;I mean in Cases of very
great Danger.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> No, no, the&mdash;auh, auh!&mdash;the Tenement is not worth the
Repairs&mdash;auh&mdash;auh&mdash;I am like an old House that is ready to drop&mdash;the
first high Wind, down I shall go&mdash;the next fit will carry me off.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Heaven forbid, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Therefore, I am resolved&mdash;auh! to settle my Affairs this
very day. You know, Nephew, you were talking of Harriet, my Lady
Lovewealth's Daughter; but my Lady truly will not consent to the
Match, unless I make you my sole Heir, which you know, Child, cannot
be, as I have another Nephew and a Niece, Sir Roger Bumper and his
Sister, whom I intend to provide for.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Very true, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> And so&mdash;Harry&mdash;as my Lady and I could not hit it off in
regard to you&mdash;she hath persuaded me to marry the Girl myself; what is
your Judgment of it, Nephew? ha!

Will, I reckon you mean.

Paper for both; and let them be drawn up as soon as possible and
looked over by my old Friend, Doctor Leatherhead; and pray bring

Age&mdash;and Infirmities&mdash;I assure you I have more Vigour than People
imagine; what think you, Lucy?

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Your Eyes, Sir, look very sparkling and lively&mdash;but I
think a&mdash;um&mdash;your other parts are not quite so brisk.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Why ay, 'tis true, my other parts are a little&mdash;a little
morbific or so, as the Doctors say; but Harriet is very young, and
she will be a charming Bedfellow. Besides, Nephew, I have a
great Satisfaction in Disappointing my Crew of Relations, who
have been like as many Undertakers for these twenty years past,
enquiring not after my Health but my Death; but I'll be revenged
on them. I will have the Pleasure of sending for 'em all, one by
one, and assuring them I will not leave a single Shilling among
them.

</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Well I can't help admiring your Intrepidity, Sir Isaac;
o' my Conscience, you have more Courage than half the young
Fellows in Town. Why what a Don Quixot are you to venture that
shattered, shabby, crazy Carcass of yours into a Marriage Bed
with a hale Constitution of Nineteen!

<p>
<i>Har.</i> What you, who are a gouty, cholicky, feverish, paralytick,
hydropic, asthmatic, and a thousand Diseases besides, venture to
light Hymen's Torch! Why, Sir, it is perfect Madness; it is making
but one Step from your Wedding to your Grave. Pray Sir, how long
do you expect to live?
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Not long I am sure if I marry you.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> You are in the right on't, Sir; it will not be consistent
with my Pleasure or my Interest that you should live above a Fortnight;
um&mdash;ay, in about a Fortnight I can do it. Let me see; ay,
it is but pulling away a Pillow in one of your coughing Fits&mdash;or
speaking properly to your Apothecary&mdash;a very little Ratsbane or
Laudanum will do the Business!
</p>

<p>

Lady Lovewealth, and what I am confident her Ladyship will highly
resent.

Death in a Fortnight after our Marriage.

so now the only Dispute between us is whether he shall be poisoned

you that I should be sent out of the World one way or t'other.
</p>

<p>

who are a mere walking Hospital! an Infirmary! O shocking! Ha!
ha! There's a Figure to go to bed with. (<i>Pointing at him and bursting

you use him thus before Marriage, what ought he to expect after it?
</p>

</p>

<p>

it shall never be in your Power, either to strangle or poison me.
Auh! Auh! I would as soon marry a she Dragon; Nephew, I beg you
will turn her out&mdash;see her out of the House, pray.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Madam, let me beg you will shorten your Visit.
</p>

<p>

with your Uncle in this Affair, but I shall insist upon his Promise
of Marriage; I can prove it, and assure yourself, Sir, if there be Law
in Westminster Hall or Doctors Commons, you shall hear from me,

<p>

</p>

<i>Shar.</i> My Name is Bumper; my Father, Sir Barnaby Bumper,
took to Wife a Lady who as I have been told was your Sister; which
said Sister, Sir, brought me into the World in less than four Months
after her Marriage.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> In four Months?
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> Yes, Sir, My Father was a little displeased with it at
first; but upon his being informed that such forward Births were
frequent in your Family, he was soon reconciled to it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> They belied our Family, Sir&mdash;for our Family&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> Hush! hush! Don't expose them. They were always a
damned whoring Family; I must confess I have frequently blushed
at the quickness of my Mother's conception, for it has often been
thrown in my Teeth; but since it has made me your Heir, that will
set me above the Disgrace.
</p>

<p>

you look so ill.

have got by Extortion and Usury and Cheating of Widows and Orphans
to whom you have been Guardian and Executor, ha&mdash;but I

alive, I was resolved I would not sleep 'till I had seen you. So
I went amongst the Coffee Houses at Covent Garden where I made
a charming Riot; I fought a Duel, beat the Watch, kicked the Bawds,
broke their Punch Bowls, clapt an old Market Woman upon her Head
in the middle of a Kennel, bullied a Justice, and made all the
Whores as drunk&mdash;&mdash;

Uncle, how long do you intend to live? Ha! I'll allow you but three
days, and if you don't die in that time, dead or alive, I'll have you
buried. For I am resolved not to stir out of Town 'till I see that
Bag of Bones of yours, that old rotten Carcass pailed up between

Rascal and a Son of a Whore, a Blockhead and deserve my Bones broke.

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Well Sir, no upbraiding now, but tell what is to be done.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> What's to be done? What should be done, Sir. Break open
his Coffers, his Cabinet, his Strong Box, seize upon his Mortgage
Deeds, and Writings, but above all take a particular Care of the Bank
Bills, and the ready Cash. I have a great Veneration for them; they
will tell no tales to your Fellow Heirs, and as the old Man has bit
you, why do you plunder them. Do you take Possession and I'll engage I

Lawyers have often made false Wills for their own Interests, and I see
no reason now why they mayn't make one for mine. I am sure I have as

Irish Solicitor, my Mother a Yorkshire Gipsy, I was begotten in Wales,
born in Scotland, and brought up at that famous University of St.

Uncle, Hussy, than a living Husband, for I shall give you to my
Nephew&mdash;and now Gentlemen of the Black Robe, who protect our
properties for us, the first thing you are to do is to fill up the
blank in the Marriage Articles with my Nephew's name instead of mine,
for he I fancy, he will be much properer to manage the young Lady's
Concerns than me. It is over with me; what think you, Harriet? Don't
you think he'll do it better than me, ha? Ah the young Jade, how she
smiles. She knows what I mean, but Gentlemen, before I make my Will, I
have one thing to observe, which is that I am a very whimsical old
Rogue! You all know that, I believe.
</p>

<p>

know.
</p>

<p>

for me to give my Nephew, which will put it out of my power to revoke
the Will I shall now make in these Presents; for I am so odd a Fellow,
that it is a hundred to one, I shall want to go from it tomorrow.

Practice with your Scruples; what is it to us whether it be a good

The Gown will get by it, let who will lose. (<i>Aside to the

</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Is it possible you ever had a Bastard?
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> Several, Doctor, but they were all dropt upon different
Parishes, except that One. Then there are some few dribbling Debts at
Alehouses and Taverns where I used to meet my Wenches&mdash;in all about
twenty Pounds.

</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> Well, beg Pardon and be satisfied. I think you have
reason&mdash;here I shall have you Master of six or seven thousand pounds
per Annum, as you call it, and almost a Plumb and a half in ready
Cole, and you are not satisfied; say one Word more and I'll tear my

selfishly or unbecoming a Rogue of Honour, I will send in for Doctor
Leatherhead and Mr. Littlewit, for they are still in the next Room,
and cancel the Will directly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> No, Rascal, you know my Love to Harriet will not let me
consent to that.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> This is just the way of the great World&mdash;the poor Rogues
are Men of parts and do all the Business&mdash;and the rich ones not only
arrogate the Merit to themselves, but are for running away with all
the Plunder.

</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> I thought so too; but it seems while we were about the
Will, Monsieur du Maigre, the Apothecary, came in and bled him in an
Instant, which has unfortunately recovered him. He is within with him
now, and one Councellour Cormorant who is come upon some Law Business
to him&mdash;O here they all come.

with an Englishman, and a Man of Honour who scorns to put an Enemy to
Death when he begs for Quarter&mdash;tho' you have been an ungenerous Ally
as ever vowed Fidelity to the Crown of England&mdash;but no matter, I'll

Uncle's having made a Will; that's all.&mdash;Don't you be like an ignorant

</p>

you know I gave you my Opinion upon it before you made it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> What, is the man mad?
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> No, Sir, I am not mad; and I would advise you not to be
foolish and whimsical as you owned about half an hour since you were
subject to.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> You did so, Sir, and you have made it. And it is
registered. And there is the Copy. Ask your Nephew, and these Ladies,
and your maid Lucy, and the Footman here.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> Upon my word, Sir, what the Doctor says is true.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> How! True, Lucy?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lucy.</i> Indeed, Sir, you did make a Will before you had your fit,
but you have forgot it, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Why this is all a Contrivance, a Conspiracy, a&mdash;pray when
did I make this Will?
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Why, Sir, it is not ten minutes since you signed it, and
all these are Witnesses. (<i>Pointing on their own side of the
room</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> No pray, Sir, leave me out. I will be sworn in any Court
in Westminster, Sir Isaac, that I know nothing of the matter.

Fripon.&mdash;Harkee, Sir, you say he make de Signature to the Will in

<i>Maigre.</i> By Gar, dat cannot be, fo[r] Monsieur Cormorant and
myself be vid him above thirteen, and he make no Will in that time,
Jarnie bleu.
</p>

<p>
<i>Coun.</i> It is very true, Gentlemen, that we can attest.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Pray Doctor, let me see this Will; read it if you please.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Sir Isaac Skinflint being seated in his great Chair&mdash;um
underwritten&mdash;Sound Senses tho' infirm in Body.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> No matter for the Preamble.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Um, um, um, committed to writing his underwritten Will,
in Manner and Form following; Imprimis, I will that all my Debts be
paid.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Debts! I do not owe one Shilling in the World.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> You forget, Sir Isaac, you owe for the Nursing of a
Bastard Child at Wandsor, and several little dribbling Debts where you
used to meet your Wenches.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> How a Bastard; why I never had a Bastard in my Life&mdash;but
once&mdash;and that was forty years ago with a great red Hair Wench, a Maid
that my Father had&mdash;but it was when I was a Lad and I did not know
what I was about.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Item, I do constitute my Nephew Bellair whole and sole
Executor, disinheriting and cutting off all other Persons.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> This is a scene of Villainy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Saving those hereafter mentioned-unto Harriet Lovewealth
my Niece that shall be, I do bequeath the set of Diamond
Bracelets&mdash;Mortgaged by the&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> This is all a Robbery.
</p>

<p>
<i>Coun.</i> Let 'em go on, Sir Isaac, you have your Remedy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> This is all a Robbery.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> To my Maid Lucy, one thousand pounds.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> O monstrous; I never intended to give her a Farthing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Item, to that honest Fellow Slipstring Shark.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> That is me, Sir Isaac, and I humbly thank your Honour.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> I bequeath him three hundred pounds per Annum during his
natural Life, to be paid out of that part of my Estate he shall think
proper.
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> O blessings on your generous Heart. It was always fond of
rewarding Merit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Read no more&mdash;I'll have every one of you indicted for
Forgery&mdash;and Conspiracy and&mdash;first take Notice, Councellour Cormorant
and Monsieur du Maigre, that I deny that Will to be any Act of
mine&mdash;and that I cancel it to all Intents and Purposes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> That you can't do, Sir&mdash;for by way of Marriage Articles
between Bellair and Harriet Lovewealth you have signed a Deed
conformable to this Will.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Why this is such a piece of Villainy as the Records of
Westminster Hall cannot match.
</p>

<p>
<i>Coun.</i> Do not be uneasy Sir Isaac, you have one, and one certain
way of oversetting all their Villainy; and that is by confessing that
you made this Will, and proving that you were out of your Senses when
you did it, which may easily be done by proper Witnesses.
(<i>Aside</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> I'll confess that or anything&mdash;to get my money again, and
to hang them all&mdash;Doctor Leatherhead, I begin now to remember
something of the making of this Will,&mdash;but I can prove I was
lightheaded and out of my Senses when I did it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Doct.</i> Sir Isaac, it is no Affair of mine.&mdash;It is your Nephew's
Concern; if he is willing to let such Chicane pass upon him, he may;
but if he has a Mind to insist upon the Will, I'll undertake to prove
you were in your Senses as perfectly as ever you were in your Life.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> And will you insist, Nephew?
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> It is not in my Power to be off it, Sir, for in
consequence that you were sincere when you made this Will, my Lady
Lovewealth here has given me her Daughter, and her own Chaplain has
just now put the finishing hand to the Business in the next Room,
before all these Witnesses.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> So you won't resign?
</p>

<p>
<i>Bell.</i> I can't, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Skin.</i> Come along, Mr. Cormorant, I'll hamper them all&mdash;I'll
prove myself out of my Senses before I sleep.
<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit Skinflint and Cormorant</i>)</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Maigre.</i> By gar, dis be all ver great, much Surprize upon me,
van, pardie, pardie make the Man make a de Vill veder he will or no,
and de Man say he will prove dat he be Lunatic and lightheaded&mdash;by
gar, me never hear de like in France, pardie, etc. etc.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Shar.</i> Well I believe this Affair is over for tonight; and upon
my Word, I am heartily glad of it, for I have been in very sweating
Circumstances ever since it began, but especially since Sir Isaac came
to Life. I was afraid that single incident would have damned our whole
Intrigue; but thanks to the Gentlemen of the Gown, I now begin to have
some hopes we shall succeed. I have done my Master's Business
completely, and as Executors go, I do not think that I have been too
partial to myself&mdash;I believe there are several honest Gentlemen who
walk the 'Change and go to Church constantly [who] would have thought
they acted very generously if they had given Bellair even an equal
Dividend&mdash;but I beg Pardon&mdash;you are to judge, not I, and unless you
approve the Deed, I shall denounce my Share of the Legacy.

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Is not my Man come in yet?
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> No, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Pray will you oblige me by letting one of your Servants
step to Covent Garden Playhouse to look for him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> I'll go myself, Sir; for I shan't be wanted 'till my Lady
comes from the Play.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Let me see (<i>pulling out his Watch</i>) 'tis now half
an hour after Seven. By this time the Fate of the Suspicious Husband
is determined; applauded to the Skies; or damned beyond Redemption;
its Author crowned with Laurel, or covered with Shame. Sure they can't
approve it! And yet the Stings I felt at the reading [of] it give me
presaging Pangs of its Success. (<i>Sighs deeply</i>) It has its
Beauties I must confess. Why should I thus grieve at a young Author's
approaching Fame? His Throes and Pangs lest it should fail have been
far short of mine lest it should succeed; nor would the Author's Joy
for its kind Reception equal my secret Rapture at its irretrievable
Disgrace. What is this that like a slow but infallible Poison corrodes
my Vitals and destroys my Peace of Mind? Emulation? (<i>Shakes his
head and sighs</i>) I am afraid the World will call it Envy. All
Mankind has some, but Authors most; and we can better brook a Rival in
our Love than in our Fame. What can detain this Rascal? I am upon the
Rack to know how it goes on&mdash;let me see, in what Manner would I have
it treated? In the first Act I would have them applaud it
violently,&mdash;in the second and third be coldly attentive,&mdash;in the
fourth begin to groan, horse laugh and whistle,&mdash;and in the fifth just
before the Catastrophe, one and all cry aloud, off, off, off! The
Epilogue! The Epilogue! O that would be delightful! Exquisite!

So Sir! You Blockhead, how came you to stay so long? But first tell me
how the Play was received; whereabouts did they begin to hiss?
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Hiss! he, he, he, Lard, Zir, why they did not hiss at
all.

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> You lye, you Rascal! (<i>Gives him a box</i>)

zing too, I think; why pray Zir, what did'st give me such a Wherrit
var?
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> How shamefully I expose my weakness to my Servant. I
would know the truth, but I cannot bear to hear it. (<i>Aside</i>)
Come, Sir, tell me (<i>Sits down in a great Chair</i>) how was it
received? But first what made you stay so long? Did I not order you to
hearken at the Pit Door and bring me Word at the end of every Act how
it went on?
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Yes Zir; you did zo, Zir; but the Vauk zhut the Door, and
then I could zee nothing at all o' the Matter.&mdash;Zo I begged them to
open the door as I might zee through it; but they were zo ztout that
they would do no zuch thing, they zaid. Zo then I went up to the
Lobby&mdash;and there I met with an auld Vellow Zervant out of
Zomersetshire. Zo he and I went up to the Footman's Gallery that I
might give my Vardie of the matter to your Honour when I came Home.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> And why did you not come away at the End of the first
Act?
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Why faith to tell your Honour the truth it made me laugh
zo I could not vind in my Heart to leave it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Rascal, how dare you tell me it made you laugh?
(<i>Strikes him</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> No indeed, Zir, it was a mistake of mine; I mean it made
me cry zo I could not leave it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Leave your blundering, you blockhead, and tell me how it
was received; did they hiss it?
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Yes Zir, yes Zir, there was as much hizzing as when your
Tragedy was acted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Rascal, how dare you mention that, hissed. (<i>Strikes
him</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Why what the Devil would you have a Man zay. You be'ent
pleased when I tell you it was clapt, nor you be'ent pleased when I
tell you it was hissed. (<i>Cries</i>) But whether you are pleased or
no, I tell you it was clapt very much and was ten times comicaller
than your Tragedy, and made the People laugh more.
</p>

<p class="ctr">
(<i>Runs off for fear of being beat</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> How this ignorant Rascal has teized me by his Account! I
can't tell whether it was damned or saved; he said it was clapt&mdash;but
he said afterwards it was hissed&mdash;it may be so for <i>it is impossible
mere Incidents</i>, which are the chief Merit of this Piece, should
make it succeed! Were I sure of that, would I had gone myself! O what
a secret Rapture should I have had in the hypocritical Exertion of my
seeming good Nature in the Author's behalf. When I was sure it would
not serve him, I would have stabbed and wounded his Fame by my pity
for his ill Success, 'till I had made both him and his Play as
contemptible as Vanity and Dullness, but the Fear of being martyred by
its Applause was insupportable. I could never have survived it.

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Mr. Heartly, yours.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Are the Ladies come home from the Play?
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Not yet, Sir; weren't you there, Mr. Heartly?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> No, Sir, I had some Business of Consequence which
prevented me. <i>I hear there were prodigious Crowds there and that
the House was full by four o'clock.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> I am surprized at that, for I think that this Author has
never writ for the Stage before.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> That may be the Reason why he excites such Curiosity
now; for the People look upon every new Author as a Candidate for
publick Fame or Disgrace; and as the Right of Election is vested in
them, each Man's Friendship, Vanity, or Envy prompts him to exert his
Authority the first Night, lest he should never have an Opportunity
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Well I wish this Gentleman well of his Election. <i>I
knew him at School and College</i>, and have some small Acquaintance
with him now; a&mdash;a&mdash;as a Man I like him extremely,
but&mdash;as&mdash;an&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;an Author, a, um,&mdash;I wish he had not writ,
that's all.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Why so Sir, I think there is not a Gentleman in Britain
but might be proud of being the Author of a well wrote Play.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Ha, ha, Lord, Mr.&mdash;sure you can't call his a Play. <i>It
is rather a Pantomime, a thing stuffed with Escapes, Pursuits, Ladders
of Ropes and Scenes in the Dark, all a parcel of Pantomimical Finesses
such as you see every Night at Rich's Entertainments. Ranger is really
the Harlequin and Mr. Strictland Colombine's Husband; though the
Author is an Acquaintance and a Man whom I respect, notwithstanding I
have so contemptible an Opinion of the Play, I heartily wish he may
succeed.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> This is a very strange way of showing your Respect, Mr.
Canker.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Sir, I assure you my Censure of the Piece arises from my
Esteem of the Author. I would have him exploded now, that he may not
expose himself by writing again. Besides I have some Concern for the
Publick; it should not be overrun with every Fool <i>who mistakes
Inclination for Genius</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Nor plagued with every invidious Wretch who mistakes
Envy for Judgment and Assurance for Parts. If the Suspicious Husband
has Merit, the Publick will reward it; if not they will condemn it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> The Publick! ha, ha, ha, Mr. Heartly, ask any Man of real
Taste and Learning what he thinks of publick Judgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> 'Tis true they have been often in the wrong, but then it
is always on the good Natured Side. They have sometimes applauded
where perhaps they should have censured, <i>but there never was an
Instance where they condemned unjustly</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Yes Sir, they condemned several of my pieces unjustly and
shamefully, and <i>if they applaud such a piece as the Suspicious
Husband</i>, I say they have lost all Taste of good Writing and true
Comedy.
</p>

<p>

the Play and can give us the whole Account of it.

<p>

Play-House, and the Players, and all of them together, for I was never
so chagrinned since I was born.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> What you did not like the Play, I suppose, Mrs. Chatter,
nor the Acting.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> O quite the contrary, Sir, I never saw a prettier Play in
all my Life, and I think Mr. Ranger the Templer is a charming Fellow!
O lud! I protest I should not care to trust myself with him in his
Chambers&mdash;well he made me laugh a thousand times tonight, with his
going up the Ladder of Ropes, and then into the Lady's Chamber, and
his dropping his Hat, and his going to ravish Jacyntha, and a thousand
comical things&mdash;but he brings all off at last. (<i>Enter Footman with

<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Pray Mrs. Chatter, if you were pleased with the Play and
the Acting, from whence arises your Distress?
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> From the oddest Accident in the World, Mr. Heartly. You
must know, Mr. Canker, that I am a vast Admirer of the Belles Lettres
as my Lady calls 'em, and never miss the first Night of a new thing&mdash;I
am as fond of a new thing as my Lady is and I assure you she often
takes my Judgment upon any new Play or Opera, and the Actors and
Actresses. For you must know, Mr. Canker, I am thought a very
tolerable Judge.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Well, but how did the Play succeed?
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> O immensely.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Was it hissed?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Was it applauded?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Psha! impossible! She knows nothing of the Matter.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> No to be sure, Mr. Canker, I know nothing of the Matter
because I did not like your Play; but I would have you to know, Sir,
that my Lady and I know a good Play when we see or read it as well as
you for all your Aristotle and your Cook upon Littleton, and all your
great Criticks.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>

I'll go and see for the Ladies.

<i>Heart.</i> So you have nettled him, Mrs. Chatter.
</p>

Harriet's; a conceited envious Wretch; he will allow nobody to have
Judgment but himself.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> But pray what was your Distress, Mrs. Chatter?
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> Why as soon as I had dropped my Lady, away went I to the
Play, and so, Sir, I mobbed it into the Pit&mdash;for you must know I
admire the Humour of the Savages in the Pit upon these Occasions of
all things; so, so, Sir, as I was saying my Lady Ramble's Woman who is
the most ignorant Animal in the Creation of the Belles Lettres [and]
knows no more of them than a Welch Attorney, well she and I and my
Lord Pride's Gentleman went together and we had immense fun, ha, ha,
ha; we made the Musick play twenty comical Tunes, and a hundred things
besides. I saw all our Ladies in the side Box and we pantomimed all
Night long at one another, and were immensely merry, and liked the
Play vastly well. There was an infinite [ly] pretty Dance at the End
of it&mdash;and the sweetest Epilogue&mdash;We encored the Dance&mdash;but they
begged they might speak the Epilogue first, so then we clapt
immensely, ha, ha.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> But I thought, Mrs. Chatter, you were going to give me
an Account of your Distress.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chat.</i> I was so, but I protest I quite forgot it&mdash;hark! is not
that our Coach stopped! Yes 'tis they&mdash;then&mdash;I beg pardon, Mr.
Heartly, but I can't possibly stay to tell you the Story now, for I
must run to my Lady.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>

</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> I am glad you were so well entertained, Madam, but you
know it was impossible for me to have the Pleasure of waiting upon
you, as I was obliged to attend my Uncle. Besides, Madam, I had your
leave to be absent. I am glad to hear the Play had such Success; pray
how does my Lady like it?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> O immoderately!
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> How happened that? She went prejudiced against it, I am
sure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> O Canker did insinuate a most villainous character of it
to us all, that's the truth on't; but <i>Sir Charles Stanza who is a
great Friend of the Author's</i> came into our Box and sat there all
Night with us; and what with his Encomiums and the Merit of the Piece,
we are all become most Violent Converts; and now my Lady like a true
Proselyte is for persecuting everybody with the Brand of Idiotism who
is out of the Pale of her Ladyship's Judgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> A true mark of Biggotry and Ignorance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> You know she is as fond of a New Wit, as a City Esquire
who is setting up to be one himself; so she begged Sir Charles would
introduce her to the Author, and he was so very obliging as to promise
to bring him here to sup this very Night.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> That was a high Compliment indeed to a Lady of her
Fondness for Authors.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> O it has won her Heart; she's distracted with it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> But dear Harriet, now to our Affairs. You see there is
no getting the better of this Fellow Canker; he has got the entire
Possession of your Aunt, and she is resolved by Marriage Contract to
give you to him this very Night. What's to be done?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> What's to be done? Why twenty things; I'll have the
Vapours, Hystericks, Cholick and Madness rather than consent, and at
last if my Aunt does persist, as I am afraid she will, why, like
Jacyntha in the new Play, it is but providing a Ladder of Ropes and a
pair of Breeches, and then the Business is done.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Dear Girl, you have eased my anxious Heart; thus let me
pay my soft Acknowledgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Thus let me pay my soft Acknowledgment. Ha, ha, ha!
(<i>Mimicking him</i>) Upon my Word and Honour you make as ridiculous
a Figure as a whining Lover in a Farce. Prithee let us have done with
this theatrical Cant.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> No, Harriet, I can never have done Loving you.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Why I don't desire you to have done loving me; I only bid
you have done telling me so&mdash;if you would please me, love me more and
tell me less.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Dear kind Creature! (<i>Kissing her Hand</i>) Pray
what's become of my Lady?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Apropos, do you know that the Irish Beau that we laughed
at so immoderately the other Night at the Opera, came into our Box and
set there all the Play?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Who, Sir Patrick Bashfull?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> The same. The Rogue has plagued me to Death with his
Civilities, his Compliments and his Blunders; he is the most fulsome
Fellow sure that ever pretended to Politeness.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Yes but the best Jest is that the Rogue is ashamed of
his Country and says he was born in France.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Well after sighing and making doux yeux at me all play
time, he would hand me to the Coach; but the Fellow squeezed me so as
we went along, that I was obliged to cry out and pull my hand away;
when we were in the Coach, I thought we had got rid of him, but the
Instant the Footman knocked at our Door, to our great Surprize who
should we find at the Coach side ready to hand us out but our Irish
Gallant. We could not avoid asking him in; he made a Million of
Apologies for his Assurance, but his chief one was that he observed
two suspicious Fellows dogging the Coach, so he followed us home to
prevent our being insulted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Ha, ha, ha, I think it was a good Irish Excuse; and pray
where is he now?

Neglect of not introducing myself sooner to your Acquaintance, but I

will run so long, Sir Patrick?
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Indeed I believe it will, my Lady, and twenty days
too&mdash;for it is a charming thing. Pray Madam, is it not one of
Shakespear's?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> O Lud no, Sir&mdash;it is entirely new, never was acted
before.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> <i>I protest, Madam, it is so very fine I took it for
one of Shakespear's&mdash;for you must know, Madam, that I am a great
Admirer of Shakespear and Milton's Comedies&mdash;they are very diverting.
O they have fine long Soliloquies in them&mdash;to be or not to be, that's
the Dispute&mdash;Don't you think, Madam, that's a charming fine Play&mdash;that
Hamlet Prince of Dunkirk, and Othello Moor of Venus they say is a very
deep Comedy, but I never saw it acted.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> To be sure Shakespear was a very tolerable Author for the
time, Sir Patrick, he writ in, but&mdash;a&mdash;he was excessively incorrect.
Don't you think he was, Mr. Heartly?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Extremely so, my Lady.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Well this Comedy is quite Aristotelian, with an infinity
of Plot&mdash;quite tip top&mdash;You will like it immensely; it is quite a high
thing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> To be sure nobody has a more elegant Taste of Works of
Genius than your Ladyship, particularly of the Drama.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Why really, Mr. Heartly, I think I have some tolerable
Ideas of the finer Arts. Mr. Canker, who is allowed to have more
critical Learning than any man since Zoilus, says I have an Exquisite
Taste of Dramatick Rules&mdash;I have given him several hints in his
Plays&mdash;and have sometimes writ an Entire Scene for him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> To be sure, Madam, your Knowledge is indisputable&mdash;but I
am afraid Mr. Canker will call your Judgment in question about this
New Play, for he rails at it excessively.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> He did abuse it to an infinite Degree before it came out;
but he will soon be convinced when he hears my Judgment of it, and to
tell you a Secret, Mr. Heartly, I am a little picqued at him for
speaking so ill of it&mdash;for I have a great Regard for the Author. Sir
Charles Stanza is to bring him to sup tonight, and we are to be
immensely intimate, and there is nothing I like so much as an
Acquaintance with a new Author.

Match&mdash;I will openly avow my Love&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Not for your Life. That would infallibly ruin us. Let my
Lady and Canker still imagine you are fond of my Sister. You and she
have dissembled it so well hitherto, that they are convinced of it;
let them continue in their Error, for if Canker gets the least
Suspicion of your Tendre for me, so inveterate is his Envy, that he

so; if he does, I will probe his Heart and raise such a Conflict in it

besides, you have said all these fine things to me a thousand times;
it is now time to drop them, and instead of Fustian speak plain Common
Sense. My Aunt has promised and vowed in my Name, and this Night by
Contract resolved to make up a Conjugal Match between you and I, but
before we play for so large a Stake as Matrimony, is it not proper to
have a good Opinion and a thorough Knowledge of the Skill and
Integrity of our Partners that we are to play with?
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, my Heart is open to your Dictates; write your own
Laws in it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> If you will let me write them in my Marriage Articles,
Sir, I shall think my Obligation to you much greater.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> With all my Heart, Madam. Name your own Conditions; I
will subscribe to them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Generous indeed, Mr. Canker; know then that I shall insist
upon an entire Change not only in your Conduct but even in your way of
thinking which will make you more agreeable to yourself and less
hateful to everybody else.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam!
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> It is a general Observation behind your back, however
complaisant People may be to your Face, that Envy is your predominant
Passion and directs in all you say or do. "As ill natured and as
Envious as Canker" is a common Simile among your Friends; and may in
time grow into a Proverb, Sir, unless you change your Conduct.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, when the Ignorant presume to judge of the finer
Arts&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Sir, your Satire is ill Nature&mdash;and your Judgment Envy.
Therefore if you have any hopes of me, you must reverse your Temper
and come into the following Treaty: In the first place instead of
making it the Business of your Life to wound the Reputation of your
Scribblers on all Occasions and explode their Plays, you must
endeavour to support them; what if you think their Productions bad,
good or bad, you must approve.&mdash;Item, I insist that you look upon me
as your Minerva, and that for the future you never presume to
Scribble, Applaud, or Condemn without first consulting me.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, I have a better Opinion of your Understanding than
to think you mean all this seriously.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Upon my Honour, then you are mistaken; I shall not marry
any Man who dares refuse to comply with these Articles&mdash;So, Sir, if
you think well of them, I desire you will give me an Instance of your
Obedience and Sincerity by going with me to the new Comedy tomorrow
Night, and publickly expressing the highest Applause at it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, you may with as much Justice ask me to reverse my
Affections, to love what I loath, and detest what I admire. No Madam,
Posterity shall never say such a wretched Performance as the
Suspicious Husband had the <i>sanction of Francis Canker</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Then, Sir, your humble Servant&mdash;I am glad I know your
Mind. Our Treaty ends here. (<i>Going, he holds her</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Dear Harriet, stay! Why will you urge me to a Behaviour
so contrary to my Nature? Consider, Madam, how ridiculous it will make
me appear to the World. Why People will think me mad.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> You are mistaken, Sir; they will only think that your good
Nature has at last got the better of your Envy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Well but Madam&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Well but Sir, I insist that you clap and laugh, nay and
that you cry too.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Cry, Madam?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Ay, cry, Sir&mdash;as soon as you see Mr. Strictland
acknowledge his Error and sue to be reconciled to his Wife; if you
have one humane particle in your Composition, I insist upon your
Sympathizing with his conscious Heart by dropping a manly Tear along
with him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, I can't come into all you command but what I can I
will. When other People laugh, I'll cry, and when they cry, I'll
laugh. Will that content you?

Proposals into ridicule.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit Harriet</i>)</span>

</p>

<p>
<i>Plag.</i> If they had been possessed with the Spirit of Zoilus,
they could not have behaved better before the Prologue was spoke; but
the Instant the Curtain was drawn up, their Clamour changed to a fixed
Attention, and their Prejudice to burst of Applause which made the
Ring.

"Silence&mdash;pray, Sir, be silent&mdash;let us hear."
</p>

<p>

same but was interrupted too by the Fools about me.

</p>

<p>
<i>Plag.</i> No Sir, nor your Comedy.

<p>
<i>Grub.</i> Nor my Mask.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Isn't it monstrous that the Publick must be deprived of
such an excellent performance as your Mask is, which is preferable to
anything Milton ever wrote for such a wretched <i>flimsy piece of
Stuff</i>?
</p>

<p>
<i>Grub.</i> Upon my word, Sir, I think the Publick is much worse used
in respect of your Comedy, which has the Art and Character of Johnson,
the Ease and Elegance of Etheridge, the Wit of Congreve, and the happy
ridiculum of Moliere; and is indisputably the best that has been
written in our Language.
</p>

<p>
<i>Plag.</i> Was there ever such Injustice shewn in a Theatre as the
setting aside my Tragedy <i>which has the Approbation of all the
Judges in England</i>?
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> It is severe Treatment no Doubt on't for your Piece
stands in the first Class of Tragedy; it is written according to the
strictest French Rules, and for the true Sublime as far beyond
Shakespear as Banks is beneath him. But what signifies the Excellence
of a Piece? Neither your Tragedy, my Comedy, nor your Mask can come
on. The Stage is quite monopolized for this Year if this Thing, I
can't call it a Play, is suffered to run.
</p>

<p>
<i>Plag.</i> Ay, and what is worse, if some means is not found out to
check it, ten to one but we shall be plagued with another next year.
</p>

<p>
<i>Grub.</i> Well, what's to be done?
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Why Gentlemen, it is a Common Cause, and requires an
active Opposition. We must try fairly to hunt it down by Journals,
Epigrams and Pamphlets;&mdash;you must attack the Characters,&mdash;you the
Sentiments and Dialogue, while I expose the Moral and the Fable.
</p>

<p>
<i>Plag.</i> With all my Heart.
</p>

<p>
<i>Grub.</i> Agreed. And now let us join the Company and try if we
can't bring them over to our Party; for tho' the most of them are
Idiots, yet they will serve to fill up the Cry, which you know is the
present Test of Right and Wrong.<span class="ralign">(<i>Exit</i>)</span>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> I am sure if you were not as great a Stranger to your own
Dullness as you are to Apollo and the Nine, as you quaintly call them,
you would never think of writing a Tragedy. But most Writers are such
vain, envious Coxcombs, and busy themselves so continually in the
pleasing Search of other People's Faults, that they never have time to
look into their own. For this Blockhead now, who has no more
Imagination than a Dutch Burgomaster, because he can common place
Corneille and Racine, sets up for the Euripides of the Age, and has
the Vanity to prefer his sleepy, lumpish Tragedy to my Comedy which
has that Viscomica, that fine Ridiculum of Human Nature which Caesar
so lauded in the Greek and so regretted the Want of in the Roman Poet.

now I remember I was there once about two or three Months ago&mdash;I went
over with a Lady for my Diversion&mdash;She went there to travel so I went
to shew her the Country because we were both Strangers in it. But
really, Madam, it was so long ago that I quite forgot it, and as I
told you before, Madam, I have a very treacherous Heart at remembering
Things when once I forgot them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> You are to be excused, Sir, for to be sure a Gentleman
that has travelled so much as you have done must have a very
treacherous Heart at remembering things. For it is common Observation
that Travellers always have bad Memories.

many Inns and Taverns upon the Road, and into so many Towns and
Villages and Steeples and Churches, that it is impossible to
Memorandum all the Kingdoms a Man travels through.

the born days of my Life, Sir&mdash;I'll tell you what, Madam, now if you
were a strange Gentleman and travelling there and happened to come
within a Mile of a Gentleman's House when you were benighted so that
you could not find your way to it, upon my Honour you might lie there
all Night and not cost you a halfpenny, tho' you had never a farthing
of Money in your Pocket.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

Scholars.
</p>

<p>

play Back Gammon the best of any Men in the World, <i>better than all
the Bishops in England</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> Then you have several good Poets in Ireland.
</p>

<p>

but knows every one of the Ninety Nine Muses, and can speak all the
Mechanical Sciences by Heart, and most of the liberal Languages except
Irish and Welch.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> And how happens it that they don't speak their own
Language?
</p>

Song I learnt there&mdash;it was made upon a beautiful young Creature that

</p>

<p>

would spoil their Voices&mdash;besides, Madam, they are not so well
qualified for it as the Italians.

been so happy a Title found out of the Alphabet.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Nay prithee now, Tim<a href="#note7p" name="noteref7p">
<small>[7]</small></a> Trifle, what do you understand by
the word Suspicion?
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Dear Nick, every Mortal knows what Suspicion means;
Suspicion comes from Suspicio, that is when any Person suspects
another.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Well I won't dispute your Definition but upon my Honour I
think it should have been the Jealous Husband.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> He, he, lud, Nibble, that would have been the most absurd
Title in the Creation. Well Nick, have you anything else in the Play
to find fault with?
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Yes, I think Ranger's Dress is another egregious Fault in
it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> His Dress a Fault in the Play?
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Ay, and intolerable one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Nay don't say that, Nick&mdash;because if you do I must laugh
at you. Why all the World admires his Dress. <i>That is thought one of
the best things in the Play.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Well now I will mention a Criticism which I defy the
warmest of Words to defend.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Well, prithee what's that, Nibble?
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Why you know Ranger's hat is laced; that I think you must
allow; that is obvious to everybody.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Well, well, granted, my dear Nibble, it is laced.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Why then I aver by all the Rules of Criticism to make the
improbability out of imposing upon Mr. Strickland, that Jacyntha's Hat
ought to be laced too, and by all that is absurd it is a plain one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Well come, there is something in that; that is a Fault I
must confess, that is a Fault by gad.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> O an unpardonable one; I assure you Jack Wagwit and a
parcel of us was going to hiss the whole Scene upon that Account.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> No, no, that would have been cruel; you know Homer
himself sometimes nodded. Don't take any Notice of it to anybody, and
it shall be altered tomorrow Night. I'll speak to the Author about
it&mdash;O here's my Lady and Mr. Canker&mdash;now for a thorough Criticism upon
it.
</p>

<p class="ctr">(<i>Enter Lady</i> CRITICK, CANKER, HEARTLY, HARRIET <i>and
Sir</i> PATRICK)
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Well, I protest Mr. Canker, I am surprized at your
Judgment. You will certainly be laughed at by all the Polite part of
the World.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, I hold the Vulgar in as much Contempt as I do the
Rabble in the Shilling Gallery; both Herds are ignorant, and praise
and condemn, or censure or applau[d], not from a Judgment in the Art,
which should be the Director, but from the ignorant Dictates of
Nature: mere Affection, like Moliere's old Woman.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Well, for my Part, I shall always prefer the irregular
Genius who from mere Affection compels me to laugh or cry, to the
regular Blockhead who makes me sleep according to Rule.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Have a Care, Mr. Heartly, none but the Ignorant ever
despised Rules.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Nor none but the ill natured or the envious ever judged
by the Extremity of Rules. And the laws of Criticism like the Penal
Laws should be explained in a favourable Sense lest the Critick like
the Judge should be suspected of Cruelty or Malice against the
Criminal.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Upon my Honour, Sir, I think you talk mighty
reasonably. I think there should be no Law [at] all, and then
everybody might do what they please.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Right, right, Sir Patrick! Liberty and Property, I
say&mdash;demme I am not for Criticks&mdash;your Homers and your Virgils&mdash;and
your Coke upon Littleton, and a parcel of Fellows&mdash;who talk of Nothing
but Gods and Goddesses&mdash;and a Story of a Cock and a Bull&mdash;as hard to
be understood as a Welch Pedigree.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Upon my Honour, so they are very hard! And that
Milton's a strange Fellow too&mdash;<i>he has got a devilish sight of
Devils along with him that nobody knows any thing of but
himself</i>&mdash;the Devil a one of 'em all I know but one&mdash;and that was
old Belzebub&mdash;you know we have often heard of him, for he was
Lucifer's Wife.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> For my Part I assure you I never could understand Milton.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Nor I, upon my Honour, Mr. Trifle&mdash;tho' I admire him
greatly, him and Shakespear are my Favourites, but I could never
understand them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> O Shakespear&mdash;old Shakespear&mdash;O Shakespear is a clever
Fellow, ay, ay,&mdash;I admire Shakespear to the Skies&mdash;I understand him
very well, Sir Patrick.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Mr. Canker, finding fault in general is unfair.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, if you will hear me, I will come to particulars
and if I don't convince you, and all the Company that it is void of
Plot, Character, Wit, Humour, Manners, and Moral, I will ever after
submit to be thought as ignorant as I now think those Criticks are who
so much admire it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> As to his want of Manners, that I think is as obvious as
Mathematical Demonstration&mdash;was there ever anything so rude as to
bring the Character of our Friend Jack Maggot on the Stage, who is a
young Fellow of Family and Fortune, and as well known about Town as I
am, and is as good natured and as inoffensive a Creature as ever
travelled. I vow as soon as ever I saw him come upon the Stage, I was
shocked.&mdash;It was vastly unpolite to introduce a young Fellow of his
Figure in Life upon a publick Theatre&mdash;I suppose he will bring some of
our Characters on the Stage in his next Play&mdash;if he does I protest
I'll make a party to hiss it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> You may be mistaken, Mr. Nibble, i[t] may be a general
and not a particular Character that is meant by Mr. Maggot.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, Mr. Nibble's Observation is just, and it is
impossible he can be mistaken. For my part, I know Jack Maggot as well
as I do myself, or as I do who is meant by Mr. Strictland.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Mr. Canker, this is most invidious Criticism and what
the best Writers from Fools and Knaves are most liable to. But instead
of injuring, it serves an Author with the Judicious; for it only
proves the Copies to be so highly finished that Ignorance and Malice
compliment them as known Originals.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> I protest, Mr. Heartly, I think you quite right in your
Answer, and if Mr. Canker has nothing more Material to offer against
the Play, he will be very Singular in his Censure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Pray what does your Ladyship think of his Ladder of
Ropes?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Why lookee, Mr. Canker, he may have transgressed
probability by it, I grant you&mdash;but I will forgive an Author such
Transgressions at any time when it is productive of so much Mirth.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Judiciously observed, my Lady.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Well, by gad, I like the Ladder of Ropes of all things.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Upon my Honour so do I.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Well, I vow I think they are vastly absurd. Pray what do
you think, Miss Harriet?
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> I think it is a very simple and a very probable Machine,
and productive of many happy Incidents, every one of which naturall[y]
arise[s] out of each other, and have this peculiar Beauty, which other
Incidents upon the Stage have not, that each of them begins with a
Surprize that raises your Anxiety and ends with a turn the least
unexpected, which could you have foreseen, would have been what you
would have wished.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Very nicely distinguished, Harriet; I protest that is the
greatest Encomium I have heard of the Play yet.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> And the justest, Madam.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> O intolerable! Monstrous! Shocking! Such Ignorance!
(<i>Aside</i>) Pray Madam, not to mention the improbability, where was
the Necessity for a Ladder of Ropes?
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> What Necessity? Arra why do you ask such a foolish
Question? I'll tell you what Necessity&mdash;Why it was put there for the
young Man, the Templer, to go up Stairs into the House.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha, ha, ha, ha!
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Very well explained, Sir Patrick; it is a proper Answer.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> But pray, Ladies&mdash;I speak to you in particular, who best
know the Nature of the Question I am going to ask&mdash;how can you justify
the impoliteness of making Clarinda, a Lady of Fashion and Fortune, in
full dress trudge the streets at twelve o'Clock at Night in
Contradiction to all Reason, Probability, and Politeness?
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Poo, poo! That's foolish now. Why what has a Stage
Play to do with Reason and Probability? If a Tragedy makes you laugh
and a Comedy makes you cry, as Mr. Heartly said just now, what would
you have more?
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha, ha, ha.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> And as to the young Lady's going home a Foot, that is
easily answered. You are to suppose it was a rainy Night and that she
walked home to save Chair hire, because there was never a Coach to be
had.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha, ha, ha.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> I am sure it is very natural to walk. I have done so a
hundred times.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha, ha, ha.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> My dear Sir Patrick, give me your Hand! Thou art the top
Critick of the Age, let me perish.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Ignorant Wretches!
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Was ever Man so tortured with such Fools!
(<i>Aside</i>)&mdash;I hope, Mr. Heartly, you will not offer to vindicate
the Dialogue. There is not one Attempt to Wit all through the Play,
but that about the Gravestone; the Characters all speak like People in
common Conversation.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> I thought that was a Beauty, Mr. Canker.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Yes just as barrenness is in Land. Don't you see, Sir,
what Whicherly and Congreve have done in their Comedies?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Yes Sir, and I know what their Masters, Terence,
Plautus, Moliere, and our own Johnson have done, who thought
themselves most excellent in their Dialogue when they could make their
Characters speak, not what was most witty, but what was most proper to
Time, Place, Character, and Circumstance.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Upon my Word, Mr. Heartly, you are a very accurate
Critick, and I am entirely of your Judgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Well, but allowing it all [it] deserves, why must it be
praised so very much?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Because, Sir, Praise is the food, and too often the only
Reward of Merit; and none deny it but the ill natured and the envious.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> And none give it but the Ignorant or the Fulsome.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Sir, that is not very Complaisant&mdash;pray Sir, who do you
mean by the Ignorant?
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Ay, Sir, who is't you mean?
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Ay, Sir, who do you mean? I hope you don't mean me.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> You, and all of you who like this Piece&mdash;You are Men,
Fops in Understanding, catch your Judgments from each other as you do
your Dress, not because they are right, but that they are the Fashion,
<i>and you make as ridiculous a Figure in Criticism as an Ape in human
Cloathing</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Give me leave to tell you, Mr. Canker, that you want
Politeness.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Madam, I am sorry your Ladyship obliges me to tell you
that you want Judgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Not to see into you, Sir&mdash;Your Envy shall never be rude
or troublesome to any of my Family again, I assure you, Sir.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> Nor shall your Ignorance or your Niece's ever be
troublesome to me again; I would as soon Match into a Family of
Hottentots.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> O mighty well, Sir!&mdash;Harriet, I desire you will never
think of Mr. Canker more.
</p>

<p>
<i>Har.</i> I shall obey your Commands, Madam.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Want Judgment! A Family of Hottentots!
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Upon my Honour that was unpolite&mdash;and you might as
well say I want Judgment.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Ay, by Gad, or I.
</p>

<p>
<i>Cank.</i> You are those kind of Judges who are brought into the
Channel of Criticism by the Springtide of Fashion, part of the Rubbish
which helps to swell it above the Mark of Truth, and with its Ebb,
return as precipitately as you came in, and are never heard of more.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Dullness seize me! If I understand what you mean by your
Springtide, your Fashion, and your Rubbish&mdash;I insist upon the Play,
[it] is a good Play&mdash;quite tip top, the best Play in life, split me!
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Faith, so it is, Mr. Trifle, a very good Play, for the
Author told me so himself&mdash;and you know it must be good when I had it
from his own Mouth.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Did you ever see the Author, Sir Patrick?
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> No, Madam, but I had it at second hand, from a third
Parson, and that's the same thing, you know.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes.</i> Ha! ha! ha!
</p>

<p class="ctr">(<i>Enter a</i> FOOTMAN)

<p>
<i>Foot.</i> Mr. Advocate the Lawyer is come; he bid me inform your
Ladyship that the Writings are ready.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Very well. (<i>Exit Footman</i>) We shall [have] no
Occasion for them tonight nor never in regard to Mr. Canker.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> I protest, Madam, this Hour's Conversation and its
Circumstances, tolerably handled, would make, a la mode a Francaise,
an agreeable Petit Piece.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Not a bad thought, I vow, Mr. Heartly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Shall I recommend it to your Ladyship? I know your
Talents for the Drama, and I'll answer for its Success.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> And so will I by Jupiter; my Lady, we'll make a party on
purpose to support it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> And so will I by all the Gods in Virgil's Iliad! O
I'll come alone with a hundred Catcalls of my Acquaintance to support
it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Shall we prevail on your Ladyship?
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Upon my Honour, I don't dislike the Whim, if you will
promise your Assistance, Mr. Heartly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Your Ladyship does me Honour; you may command me and Mr.
Canker shall be the Hero.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Really I am afraid his Character is so very high that the
Audience will never allow it to be natural.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> That part of the Audience who would know the Copy by
themselves might condemn it through Policy as being exaggerated, but
the Candid and Judicious who could not be hurt by it and who know the
Nature of Envy would approve it. Besides Farce will admit of
Characters being a little outre.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> I protest you are a mighty good Critick, Mr. Heartly, but
I am afraid we shall want Plot in our Petit Piece, Mr. Heartly.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Not at all, my Lady! There is no great Demand for Plot
in a Farce, but to please the Criticks we'll have a little. The main
Business must be the exposing an envious Author, and the Plot must be
to provoke his Envy to neglect his Mistress and to quarrel with your
Ladyship, the Poetical Justice of which must be your breaking off the
intended Match, and giving me his Mistress, who am to be his Rival;
and as the Piece is to be a temporary thing, I dare say the Audience
will make reasonable Allowances.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> I vow I like the Contrivance mightily, and I think
there's something very Singular and very Novel.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> And pray, Heartly, what part shall I have in it?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> You shall be the Jack Maggot of the Farce, which shall
be so trifling that you may be either kept in or left out.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> And what part shall I have in your Play, Mr. Heartly?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Really, Sir Patrick, I know no Business you can have in
it, unless it be to make the Audience laugh.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Pat.</i> Faith then I have a good Hand at that&mdash;for I am so
very witty that I always make Company laugh wherever I come.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nib.</i> Mr. Heartly, give me leave to tell you your Farce will
never succeed, for your Characters will be too high for that Species
of the Drama, and not half ridiculous enough.
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> To remedy that, Sir, we will bring in your Character at
the End of the Farce as a Satyr upon all Criticks who find fault with
Trifles.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trif.</i> Ha, ha, admirable! That will be delightful! Quite tip top
or may I perish, ha.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lady.</i> Pray what shall we call our little Piece, Mr. Heartly?
</p>

<p>
<i>Heart.</i> Why really, Madam, I can't think of any Title better at
present than the New Play Criticized, or the Plague of Envy.
